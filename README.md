# Picture-Circle-Packing

A Processing sketch made using the processing IDE.
Basically an image in the data folder is imported, after which the sketch draws the specified amount of circles at random locations with their color corresponding to the color of the pixel of the image at that location. The circles drawn will grow in size until they touch a boundary or another circle, resulting in a bubbly looking image.

To run the sketch, you would need the processing IDE.

To change the image, go to the data folder and add an image of your own. Then in the code, change the imageName variable to the name of your image. After this you need to change the resolution of the sketch to match the resolution of your image, this can be done by changing the parameters in the size function called within the setup funtion.

You can change the number of circles spawned by changing the length of the arraylist created at line 1.
